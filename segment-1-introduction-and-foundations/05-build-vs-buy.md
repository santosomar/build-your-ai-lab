## Hybrid Approach

### Best of Both Worlds

**Option 1: Buy Base System, Upgrade Later**
- Purchase pre-built with good CPU/motherboard
- Upgrade GPU yourself (easiest component)
- Add storage as needed
- Upgrade RAM when required

**Option 2: Buy Barebones Kit**
- Includes case, PSU, motherboard
- Add CPU, RAM, GPU, storage yourself
- Partial warranty coverage
- Easier than full DIY

**Option 3: Professional Assembly**
- Buy all components yourself
- Pay for professional assembly ($100-$300)
- Get component quality + professional build
- Some shops offer warranty

## Building Your First System

### Step-by-Step Process

**1. Planning (1-2 weeks)**
- Define requirements and budget
- Research components
- Check compatibility (PCPartPicker)
- Read reviews
- Watch build guides

**2. Purchasing (1 week)**
- Buy from reputable retailers
- Check return policies
- Consider shipping times
- Keep all boxes and receipts

**3. Assembly (4-8 hours)**
- Watch video tutorials
- Follow motherboard manual
- Take your time
- Cable management as you go

**4. Initial Boot (1-2 hours)**
- Check POST (Power-On Self-Test)
- Enter BIOS
- Verify all components detected
- Enable XMP/DOCP for RAM

**5. OS Installation (2-4 hours)**
- Install operating system
- Update BIOS and drivers
- Install essential software
- Run stability tests

**6. Testing (4-8 hours)**
- Stress test CPU (Prime95, Cinebench)
- Stress test GPU (FurMark, 3DMark)
- Memory test (MemTest86)
- Monitor temperatures
- Verify stability

### Common First-Build Mistakes

**Forgetting I/O Shield**
- Install before motherboard
- Easy to forget
- Annoying to fix later

**Incorrect RAM Installation**
- Use correct slots (check manual)
- Usually slots 2 and 4 for dual-channel
- Press firmly until clicks

**Forgetting Motherboard Standoffs**
- Can short circuit motherboard
- Usually pre-installed in case
- Verify before mounting

**Not Connecting All Power Cables**
- CPU power (4+4 or 8-pin)
- Motherboard power (24-pin)
- GPU power (6+2 pin, often multiple)
- Storage power (SATA or built-in)

**Poor Cable Management**
- Affects airflow
- Looks messy
- Harder to upgrade later
- Do as you build, not after

**Overtightening Screws**
- Can crack PCB
- Strip threads
- Finger-tight plus quarter turn

## Warranty Considerations

### DIY Warranties

**Component Warranties:**
- CPU: 1-3 years
- GPU: 2-3 years
- Motherboard: 1-3 years
