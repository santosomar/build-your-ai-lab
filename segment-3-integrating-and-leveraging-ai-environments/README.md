# Segment 3: Integrating and Leveraging AI Environments

## Overview
This segment focuses on creating hybrid AI labs that combine home and cloud resources, and working with open-source models.

## Topics Covered

### Hybrid AI Labs: Combining Home and Cloud Resources

#### Integration Strategies
- When to use home vs. cloud resources
- Seamless workflow between environments
- Load balancing and resource allocation
- Failover and redundancy strategies

#### Synchronizing Data and Projects
- Version control with Git
- Cloud storage integration (S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob)
- Data pipeline orchestration
- Keeping environments in sync

#### Leveraging the Strengths of Both Environments
- Development on local, training in cloud
- Prototyping locally, scaling in cloud
- Cost optimization through hybrid approaches
- Data locality and compliance considerations

### Running Open-Source Models from Hugging Face

#### Popular Open-Source Models
- **Llama**: Meta's large language model
- **Phi**: Microsoft's small language model
- **DeepSeek**: High-performance open models
- **Gemma**: Google's large language model
- **Gemma Nano**: Google's lightweight model
- **Qwen**: Alibaba's large language model
- **FoundationSec**: Cisco's cybersecurity open weights model
- Other notable models and their use cases

#### Model Selection Criteria
- Model size and hardware requirements
